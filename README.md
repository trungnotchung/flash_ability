## iOS Development Setup Guide

To develop and run the application on iOS, follow the steps below:

### 1. Install Xcode
- Download Xcode from the Mac App Store.

- After installation, open Xcode and download the iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator.

- Note: The simulator package is quite large (~8GB), so ensure you have enough disk space.

### 2. Choose Your Code Editor
- You can use Cursor or any code editor of your choice.

- It is not mandatory to write code directly inside Xcode.

### 3. Launch the iOS Simulator
- Once the simulator is installed, you can start it using the following terminal command:

```bash
open -a Simulator
```

This will launch the iPhone simulator you previously installed.
